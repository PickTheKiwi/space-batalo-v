# Space Batalo V
This is a remake of my old game Space Batalo. It is written in Java and was originally made for a school project. I have since then decided to remake it in V and fix bugs, and possibly add new features.

## Compiling from source
To compile from source, you need to have V installed. You can get it from [here](https://vlang.io/). Then, you can run the game from source the game by running `v run main.v` in the root directory of the project. Or you can compile it to an executable by running `v main.v` in the root directory of the project.

## Running the game
If you are running from the executable, you can run it by running `./main` in the root directory of the project. If you are running from source, you can run it by running `v run main.v` if you have V installed.
